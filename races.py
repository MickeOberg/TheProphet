northwest Tamriel—Bretons, Redguards, and Orcs—that forms an alliance of mutual defense, with a vision of establishing peace and order across Tamriel. \
Indeed, the kings of the Covenant take the Remans as their model, claiming to be the spiritual heirs of the Second Empire.\
So this is the modern Daggerfall Covenant, an alliance of the Redguards of northern Hammerfell, under King Fahara’jad; the Orcs of the mountainous \
northeast, under King Kurog of Orsinium; with the Breton King Emeric of High Rock presiding from his palace in Wayrest. At its best, it is a noble \
alliance of honorable and chivalrous peoples, representing all the best aspects of the First and Second Empires. And from this solid foundation, \
perhaps a third, even mightier Empire shall arise, providing all the peoples of Tamriel the benefits of mutual respect, vigorous trade, and reverence \
for the Divines.\n\
